# Collabera Capstone

1. Read through documentation for Google Dataflow and Apache Beam
2. Logged into and saved credientials within Terminal
3. Found example code for Google Cloud Storage, Google Dataflow, and Apache Beam for Python
4. Created a simple json file for testing purposes
5. Made many attempts at implementing the json to csv component of the project design
6. Finally implemented the json to csv component of the project design


Challenges faced:
- How to utilize DoFn 
- Understanding how the process function should work
- Converting a large json file to csv used a lot memory
-   Will need to find a way to optimize this issue (pub sub perhaps?)
- 
- How to transform the data within the pipeline
-
